# Discord Bot
A discord bot to do what my telegram bot does:
    - Start a timer on an ESP  [node-red nodes](https://github.com/TerrificTable/discordjs_bot/blob/master/resources/node-red%20nodes.json)
    - Start a counter on an ESP [node-red nodes](https://github.com/TerrificTable/discordjs_bot/blob/master/resources/node-red%20nodes.json)
    - Get an image of a graph from grafan

maybe i will put code to turn on (and off) leds into the bot too
