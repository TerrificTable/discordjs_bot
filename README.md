# Discord Bot
A discord bot to do what my telegram bot does:
    - Start a timer on an ESP  [node-red nodes]()
    - Start a counter on an ESP [node-red nodes]()
    - Get an image of a graph from grafan

maybe i will put code to turn on (and off) leds into the bot too

[ESP Sources Code](https://github.com/TerrificTable/ESP-8266--AirGiano) (Currently has no leds thingy, just displays some stuff on screen)
